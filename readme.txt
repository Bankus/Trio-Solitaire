Hello!

This is just a cute little Solitaire client I'm making for a couple of friends, featuring all 3 of their illustrious baby boys.

Suggestions welcome! This is just a hacky little home project, so I'm not putting *too* much effort into it, but I'm always happy to see what people have to say about my code.

god bless
